# Shiny_ReporteRs_Demo
A demonstration of using Shiny and ReporteRs to auto-generate reactive *.pptx reports

These are some example and tutorial notes I wrote up after a recent project where I used the ReporteRs package for the first time.  The package's docmentation is great, so these are just a few tips based on where I got stuck. I provide notes, sample code, and sample template for running an example locally.

On my website (http://www.kdv-decisions.com/projects.html), you will find a link to the YG360 Leadership Development app that I developed for Onfoot Consulting along with two demo data files.  These provide a real-life example of a larger Shiny-ReporteRs project.

Further explanation is in the file: Shiny_ReportRs_DemoInstructions.pdf
