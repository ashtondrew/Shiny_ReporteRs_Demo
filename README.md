# Shiny_ReporteRs_Demo
A demonstration of using Shiny and ReporteRs to auto-generate reactive *.pptx reports

These are some example and tutorial notes I wrote up after a recent project where I used the ReporteRs package for the first time.  The package's docmentation is great, so these are just a few tips based on where I got stuck. 

In the Github directory, you will find two data files to pay with the app I developed online as a real-life example.  Then I provide notes, sample code, and sample template for running an example locally.

Further explanation is in the file: Shiny_ReportRs_DemoInstructions.pdf
